The Odin Project, Where's Waldo?

What Did I learn?

1. I was using an older version of react-router-dom in my shopping cart project.
   There were some changes which I had to revise.
2. Image mapping. May need to install npm package, but as of this current version,
   just uses html basics.

Problems

1. Map with image mapping not taking in dropcomponent.
