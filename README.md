This project was created based off of The Odin Project, Where's Waldo?

## What Did I learn?

1. I was using an older version of react-router-dom in my shopping cart project.
   There were some changes which I had to revise.
2. Image mapping. May need to install npm package, but as of this current version,
   just uses html basics.
3. Used Cloud Firestore (NoSQL cloud database) to sync coordinates to prevent
   cheating by looking at coordinates.

## Problems

1. Map with image mapping not taking in dropcomponent.
2. Should try reusing image component instead of creating 2 seperate js files. However, since there was only 2 pictures, copy and pasting was quicker than passing more props. To be more scalable, could recreate image component.
